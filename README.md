- 👋 Hi, I’m @AR-Philip
- 👀 I’m interested in everything considering Data Science, Machine Learning that can potentially be used in mechanical or aerospace engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build and train neural networks to play games and process data relevant to engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on design of experiments, optimisation machine learning applications in engineering
- 📫 How about writing me an email on philip.lohde@haw-hamburg.de
